# 🌍 Green Economy Trade Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the role of **international trade in environmental goods** and its contribution to the global green economy. Using **UN Comtrade data (1995–2021)**, we analyzed bilateral trade flows to uncover trends, identify top exporters/importers, detect imbalances, and highlight opportunities for sustainable growth.  

The work was completed as part of an **Integrated Data Science project** using **R, RMarkdown, and data visualization tools**.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
As the world transitions toward greener industries, trade in environmental goods has become a key driver of sustainability. However, trade flows remain uneven across countries and regions. This project investigates:  

1. Which regions and partners dominate trade in environmental goods?  
2. How have imports and exports evolved over the years?  
3. Where do trade imbalances or dependencies exist?  
4. What insights can guide policy and investment in the green economy?

## 🛠 Methods  
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and transformed ~150,000 rows of trade data using `dplyr` and `tidyverse`.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Grouped by year, country, and partner to calculate trade shares, balances, and growth.  
- **Visualization**: Created time series plots, trade balance graphs, and heatmaps to reveal patterns.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Measured growth trends and compared top vs. bottom groups of traders.

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- **Strong Growth**: Trade in environmental goods has grown steadily since the 1990s.  
- **Concentration of Power**: A few regions dominate exports, while others rely heavily on imports.  
- **Emerging Exporters**: Developing economies are beginning to transition from **net importers → net exporters**, signaling industrial growth.  
- **Imbalances**: Trade disparities persist, with some economies maintaining consistent trade surpluses while others remain in deficit.  
- **Clusters**: Trade partnerships are often regionally concentrated, leaving gaps for diversification.

## ✅ Conclusion  
The study shows that while trade in environmental goods is expanding globally, it is highly concentrated among a few economies. For the green transition to be more equitable, developing regions need to reduce import dependency and strengthen their role as exporters.  

This analysis demonstrates how **data science can provide actionable insights for sustainability** by combining **statistical methods, visualization, and trade analytics**.
